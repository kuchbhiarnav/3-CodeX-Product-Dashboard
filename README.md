This repository contains the project files and code for the CodeX Marketing Insights Project, as part of the Resume Project Challenge. The project focuses on providing valuable insights to CodeX's Marketing Team in the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry.

# Project Overview
CodeX, a German beverage company, recently launched its energy drink in 10 cities across India. The goal of this project was to analyze survey data collected from 10,000 respondents and extract meaningful insights to drive strategic actions for the Marketing Team. The project aimed to enhance brand awareness, increase market share, and guide product development strategies.

# Key Findings and Solutions
The analysis uncovered several key findings and proposed actionable solutions:

Targeted Marketing: Recognizing distinct consumer preferences and demographics across the 10 cities, the recommendation is to tailor marketing campaigns to specific locales for maximum impact.

Brand Perception Enhancement: By understanding consumer sentiment, including positive and negative brand perceptions, the Marketing Team can strengthen strengths and address any weaknesses.

Competitive Analysis: A comprehensive comparative analysis of competing energy drink brands in India highlighted their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning. CodeX can use this knowledge to refine its marketing strategy and stand out from competitors.

Product Development Insights: Through survey responses, popular flavor choices, preferred packaging formats, and price sensitivity among consumers were identified. This data will inform product development decisions and align offerings with consumer demands.

Influencer Marketing: The power of social media influencers was recognized, and potential brand advocates in the F&B industry with substantial followings were identified. Collaborating with these influencers will amplify CodeX's marketing efforts.
